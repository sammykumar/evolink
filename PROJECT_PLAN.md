# Project Plan

## 04/26/2025

- Realized I don't need to compile neolink's source code into addon's docker image becasue I can download v0.6.2's compiled binary and just run it on the container
- Add source code to long term roadmap
- Need to revert cargo lock file at some point

## 05/10/2025

- Downloaded all the neolink 0.6.2 binaries
